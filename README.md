# Advent of Code Solutions Repository

Welcome to my Advent of Code solutions repository! Here, I'll be sharing interesting and challenging solutions to selected problems from the Advent of Code event. Rather than publishing every solution, I'll focus on the ones where I put extra effort and creativity.

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding event that features a series of programming challenges released daily in December. Each challenge is designed to be a fun and engaging way to improve your problem-solving and programming skills.

## Repository Structure

- **/yearX**: Each year's solutions are organized in separate directories.
  - **/dayYY**: Solutions for each day's challenge.
    - **README.md**: Explanation and details about the specific problem.
	- **task.md**: Description of the task.
    - **solution.smth**: My solution to the problem.

## Selected Solutions

I will only publish solutions that I find particularly interesting, challenging, or those that involve creative problem-solving. Short Python scripts without much complexity may not be included.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the solutions and use them as a reference for your own learning. Each solution directory includes a README.md file providing details about the problem and the thought process behind the solution.

Make sure to check the README for any additional setup or requirements.

## Contributing

I encourage you to share your insights, improvements, or alternative solutions through discussions. Open an issue if you have suggestions, or participate in existing discussions.
